# Dataset Management and Basic Analysis System 
This project is a simple Python program that reads numerical and categorical data from files, performs basic analysis, and generates a report.
It was built to practice core Python concepts such as file handling, error handling, functions, loops, sets, and object-oriented programming (OOP).

# Features
- Reads numerical data from a text file
- Handles file errors and invalid values
- Calculates:
   - Total
   - Average
   - Minimum
   - Maximum
 - Determines performance level based on a threshold
 - Extracts unique categories using sets
 - Uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
 - Saves results into a report file

# Technologies Used
- Python 3
